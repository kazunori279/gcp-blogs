We are excited to announce that Vertex AI Vector Search 2.0 (VS2.0) is now in Public Preview.

This release introduces a powerful, simple-to-use retrieval engine designed to streamline AI development and serve as the knowledge core for your AI applications (e.g. RAG, Search). 

VS2.0 lets you go from 0 to prototype in less than 5 minutes, and seamlessly scale to production.

What is Vector Search 2.0?

Vector Search 2.0 creates a powerful, semantic retrieval engine for any AI application with minimal lines of code. It provides a clear path from raw data to rich, contextual answers, handling the complexities of embedding and indexing without any infra work.

Designed from the ground up, VS2.0 offers a radically simplified developer experience that allows you to move from 0 to production-scale retrieval in minutes.

Key use cases: RAG, semantic and/or keyword search, recommendation engines, agentic retrieval, image/video search, ad serving, and many more!

Key Features & Benefits

🚀 Zero Indexing to Billion-Scale Index Start developing immediately with zero indexing time using kNN, then scale to billions of vectors with millisec latency with Google-scale ANN indexes for production - all with the same API and same dataset.

🗂️ Introducing Collections: Unified Data & Vectors Store your vectors and the original data together in a single resource.

⚡ Auto-Embeddings Configure auto-embedding on data insertion to populate vector fields automatically, significantly simplifying the ingestion pipeline.

🔍 Hybrid Search & Ranking Combine vector, full-text, and built-in semantic re-ranking in a single parallel query.

☁️ Zero Infrastructure Management VS2.0 is designed to be serverless with index auto-tuning and auto-scaling built in.

🔗 Broad Integrations [launching by end of year] VS2.0 is designed to connect with the tools developers already use: ADK, LangChain, LlamaIndex, or connecting through an MCP server.

💰 Cost-Efficient Tiers Choose between performance-optimized backed by RAM and storage-optimized tier backed by SSDs, for the right balance of cost and performance.
