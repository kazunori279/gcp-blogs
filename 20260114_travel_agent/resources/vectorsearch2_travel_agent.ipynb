        "# End-to-End Travel Agent: Vector Search 2.0 + ADK\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates the complete workflow for building a **Gen AI Travel Agent** using **[Vertex AI Vector Search 2.0](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search-2/overview)** and **[Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is Vector Search 2.0?\n",
        "\n",
        "Vector Search 2.0 is Google Cloud's fully managed, self-tuning vector database built on Google's [ScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors)](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann) algorithm - the same technology powering Google Search, YouTube, and Google Play.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Features\n",
        "\n",
        "| Feature | Description |\n",
        "|---------|-------------|\n",
        "| **Zero Indexing to Billion-Scale** | Start immediately with kNN (no indexing), scale to billions with ANN indexes |\n",
        "| **Unified Data Storage** | Store vectors and metadata together (no separate database needed) |\n",
        "| **Auto-Embeddings** | Automatic embedding generation using Vertex AI models like `gemini-embedding-001` |\n",
        "| **Built-in Full Text Search** | No need to generate sparse embeddings yourself |\n",
        "| **Hybrid Search** | Combine semantic + keyword search with [RRF ranking](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf) |\n",
        "| **Self-Tuning** | Auto-optimized performance without manual configuration |\n",

        "### Core Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "Vector Search 2.0 has three main components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **[Collections](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search-2/collections/collections)**: Schema-enforced containers for your data\n",
        "2. **[Data Objects](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search-2/data-objects/data-objects)**: Individual items with data fields and vector embeddings\n",
        "3. **[Indexes](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search-2/indexes/indexes)**: kNN (instant, dev) or ANN (fast, production-scale)\n",
        "\n",
        "## What We'll Build\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we'll:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Build the Knowledge Core**: Ingest real Airbnb data into Vector Search 2.0, using auto-embeddings and metadata storage\n",
        "2. **Build the Agent**: Use ADK to create an agent that reasons about user intent\n",
        "3. **Connect Them**: Wrap Vector Search 2.0 as a **Tool** that the Agent calls autonomously to find rentals\n",
