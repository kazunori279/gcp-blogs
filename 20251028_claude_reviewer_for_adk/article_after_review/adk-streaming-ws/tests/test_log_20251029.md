## Overview

This work log documents the complete process of building the ADK Streaming WebSocket sample application following the instructions in the article `custom-streaming-ws.md`.

---

## Build Process

### Step 1: Create Temporary Folder

**Command:**
```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/adk-streaming-test
```

**Outcome:** ✅ Success
**Notes:** Created temporary folder successfully under `/tmp/`

---

### Step 2: Create and Activate Virtual Environment

**Commands:**
```bash
cd /tmp/adk-streaming-test
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Outcome:** ✅ Success
**Notes:** Virtual environment created and activated successfully using Python 3.12

---

### Step 3: Install ADK 1.17.0

**Command:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade google-adk==1.17.0
```

**Outcome:** ✅ Success
**Details:**
- ADK 1.17.0 was already installed in the virtual environment
- All dependencies were satisfied
- Notable dependencies include:
  - FastAPI 0.120.1
  - google-genai 1.46.0
  - google-cloud-aiplatform 1.122.0
  - uvicorn 0.38.0
  - websockets 15.0.1

**Improvement Point:**
- A pip upgrade notification was shown (`pip 24.3.1 -> 25.3`), but this is optional and doesn't affect functionality

---

### Step 4: Set SSL_CERT_FILE Variable

**Command:**
```bash
export SSL_CERT_FILE=$(python -m certifi)
```

**Outcome:** ✅ Success
**Value Set:** `/private/tmp/adk-streaming-test/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem`

**Notes:**
- This step is important for SSL certificate verification
- The certifi package was already installed as part of ADK dependencies

---

### Step 5: Clone and Setup Sample Code from GitHub

**Commands:**
```bash
git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/google/adk-docs.git
cd adk-docs
git sparse-checkout init --cone
git sparse-checkout set examples/python/snippets/streaming/adk-streaming-ws
git checkout main
```

**Outcome:** ✅ Success (after one retry)

**Friction Encountered:**
- First attempt failed with: `fatal: destination path 'adk-docs' already exists and is not an empty directory`
- **Resolution:** Removed existing directory with `rm -rf adk-docs` and re-cloned

**Files Retrieved:**
```
./app/.env
./app/google_search_agent/__init__.py
./app/google_search_agent/agent.py
./app/static/index.html
./app/main.py
```

**Improvement Point:**
- The article could mention checking if the directory already exists before cloning
- Consider adding a cleanup step or using `git clone` with force option

---

### Step 6: Configure Platform Credentials (.env file)

**Configuration Used:**
```env
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyAolZBjJo6t04fvCNovwzZuM6Q1u8X71fs
```

**Outcome:** ✅ Success
**Platform Selected:** Google AI Studio (using API Key)

**Notes:**
- The original `.env` file was empty (1 line only)
- Configuration was provided by user
- File location: `/tmp/adk-streaming-test/adk-docs/examples/python/snippets/streaming/adk-streaming-ws/app/.env`

---

### Step 7: Start the FastAPI Application
