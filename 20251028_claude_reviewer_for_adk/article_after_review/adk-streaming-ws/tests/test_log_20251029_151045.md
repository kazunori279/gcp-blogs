## Test Results

### Text Mode Testing (✅ Successful with Notes)

**Connection:**
- Client #86833342 connected with `is_audio=false`
- WebSocket connection established successfully
- Static files loaded correctly:
  - `/` (index.html)
  - `/static/js/app.js`
  - `/static/js/audio-player.js`
  - `/static/js/audio-recorder.js`

**User Input:**
- Message sent: "what time is it now?"
- Server received: `[CLIENT TO AGENT]: what time is it now?`

**Agent Response:**
```
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio transcript: It's 6
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: 11114 bytes.
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: 11520 bytes.
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: 11520 bytes.
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio transcript:  13
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: 15360 bytes.
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: 15360 bytes.
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio transcript:  AM
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: 9600 bytes.
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: 9600 bytes.
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: 9600 bytes.
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio transcript:  UTC.
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: 9600 bytes.
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: 9600 bytes.
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: 9600 bytes.
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: 9600 bytes.
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: 9600 bytes.
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: 9600 bytes.
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: 1920 bytes.
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: {'turn_complete': True, 'interrupted': None}
```

**Observations:**
1. **Native Audio Model Behavior**: Even though the client connected in text mode (`is_audio=false`), the server sent both audio transcripts AND audio/PCM data. This is expected behavior because:
   - The model is `gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio-09-2025` (a native audio model)
   - The code in `main.py` forces AUDIO modality for native audio models:
     ```python
     is_native_audio = "native-audio" in model_name.lower()
     modality = "AUDIO" if (is_audio or is_native_audio) else "TEXT"
     ```
   - This ensures native audio models always work in their optimal mode

2. **Audio Transcription**: The `output_audio_transcription` feature successfully provided text representation of audio:
   - "It's 6 13 AM UTC."
   - Transcripts sent incrementally as chunks

3. **Turn Completion**: Turn completion event sent correctly with `turn_complete: True`

### Audio Mode Testing (✅ Successful - Partial)

**Connection:**
- Client #86833342 reconnected with `is_audio=true`
- Audio processor worklets loaded successfully:
  - `/static/js/pcm-recorder-processor.js`
  - `/static/js/pcm-player-processor.js`

**Agent Response Start:**
```
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio transcript: The time
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: 11114 bytes.
```

**Connection Termination:**
```
Connection closed: received 1011 (internal error) RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: Maximum google search tool usage exceeded.
```

### Error Encountered

**Error Type**: RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
**Error Code**: 1011 (WebSocket internal error)
**Error Message**: "Maximum google search tool usage exceeded"

**Analysis:**
- The Google Search tool has usage limits/quotas
- Multiple test queries within a short time period exceeded the quota
- This is a quota limitation from the Google Search API, not an application bug
- The error was properly caught and the WebSocket connection closed gracefully

**Impact:**
- Prevents continuous testing with the Google Search tool
- Users may encounter this during heavy usage or rapid testing

## Issues and Frictions

### 1. Virtual Environment Symlink Issue (⚠️ Minor)
- **Issue**: Default `venv` creation fails on macOS due to symlink restrictions in `/tmp`
- **Impact**: Initial setup requires additional troubleshooting
- **Workaround**: Use `--copies` flag
- **Suggestion**: Update documentation to mention this macOS-specific issue and provide the `--copies` flag solution

### 2. Virtual Environment Reuse (ℹ️ Information)
- **Observation**: The test reused an existing virtual environment from another location
- **Behavior**: All packages were already satisfied, showing "Requirement already satisfied"
- **Impact**: Unclear if a fresh installation would work identically
- **Suggestion**: Consider testing with a completely fresh virtual environment to validate first-time installation

### 3. Google Search Tool Quota Limits (⚠️ Important)
- **Issue**: Google Search tool has usage quotas that can be easily exceeded during testing
- **Impact**: Interrupts testing workflow and user experience
- **Suggestion**:
  - Document this limitation in the article
  - Provide guidance on:
    - Expected quota limits
    - Error handling for quota exhaustion
    - Alternative tools or fallback mechanisms
    - Rate limiting strategies for production use

### 4. Missing Favicon (ℹ️ Minor)
- **Issue**: Browser requested `/favicon.ico` which returned 404
- **Impact**: No functional impact, only cosmetic
- **Suggestion**: Add a favicon to improve polish

### 5. Initial Audio Connections (ℹ️ Information)
- **Observation**: Two initial audio connections (`#39265957`) were established and then immediately disconnected
  ```
  Client #39265957 connected, audio mode: true
  Client #39265957 connected, audio mode: true
  Client disconnected from client_to_agent_messaging
  Client disconnected from client_to_agent_messaging
  ```
- **Analysis**: This appears to be browser behavior during initial page load/connection establishment
- **Impact**: No functional impact, but creates noise in logs
- **Suggestion**: Consider adding connection state tracking to distinguish between intentional disconnects and connection errors

## Positive Findings

## Improvement Suggestions

### For Documentation (custom-streaming-ws.md)

1. **Add macOS /tmp Virtual Environment Note:**
   ```markdown
   **macOS Users**: If you encounter symlink errors when creating the virtual environment in `/tmp`, use the `--copies` flag:
   ```bash
   python -m venv --copies .venv
   ```
   ```

2. **Document Google Search Tool Quotas:**
   ```markdown
   ### Google Search Tool Usage Limits

   The `google_search` tool has usage quotas. If you encounter `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: Maximum google search tool usage exceeded` errors:

   - Wait a few minutes before retrying
   - Consider implementing rate limiting for production applications
   - Use alternative tools or caching for high-volume scenarios
   ```

3. **Add Troubleshooting Section:**
   - Include common errors and solutions
   - Document the quota exhaustion error specifically
   - Provide debugging tips for WebSocket connection issues

4. **Clarify Native Audio Model Behavior:**
   ```markdown
   **Important**: When using native audio models (model names containing "native-audio"), the application automatically forces AUDIO modality regardless of the `is_audio` parameter. This ensures optimal performance for models designed with native audio capabilities.
   ```

### For Application Code

1. **Add Quota Error Handling:**
   - Detect RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED errors
   - Send user-friendly error message to client
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries

2. **Add Favicon:**
   - Include a simple favicon.ico to eliminate 404 errors
   - Improves professional appearance

3. **Enhance Logging:**
   - Add timestamps to application logs (not just uvicorn logs)
   - Distinguish between expected disconnections and errors
   - Add connection lifecycle events (connected → active → disconnected)

4. **Add Health Check Endpoint:**
   ```python
   @app.get("/health")
   async def health_check():
       return {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
   ```

5. **Session Management Enhancement:**
   - Add session cleanup for disconnected clients
   - Implement connection timeout handling
   - Track active sessions for monitoring
